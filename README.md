## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

Ensure you have the following installed on your system:

- Java 8 or higher
- Maven
- MySQL database

### Installation

1. Clone this repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/zeeshank1/curd-app-java8-springboot-mysql.git
   cd curd-app-java8-springboot-mysql
   ```

2. Configure the MySQL database:
   - Create a MySQL database named `curd_app` (or modify the `application.properties` file to use a different name).
   - Update the database connection settings in `src/main/resources/application.properties`:
     ```properties
     spring.datasource.url=jdbc:mysql://localhost:3306/curd_app
     spring.datasource.username=your_username
     spring.datasource.password=your_password
     ```

3. Build the project:
   ```bash
   mvn clean install
   ```

4. Run the application:
   ```bash
   mvn spring-boot:run
   ```

## Usage

Once the application is running, you can interact with it through the provided REST API endpoints. Use tools like [Postman](https://www.postman.com/) or `curl` to test the endpoints.

---

## API Endpoints

Here are the CRUD endpoints available in this application:

- **Create**: `POST /api/resource`  
  Add a new resource.

- **Read**:  
  - `GET /api/resource` - Retrieve all resources.  
  - `GET /api/resource/{id}` - Retrieve a resource by its ID.

- **Update**: `PUT /api/resource/{id}`  
  Update an existing resource by its ID.

- **Delete**: `DELETE /api/resource/{id}`  
  Delete a resource by its ID.

Replace `resource` with the entity name defined in your application.
